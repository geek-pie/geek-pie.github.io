## Features

Major theme of this release is support for multiple namespaces/multitenancy in Fission.

### Fission CLI Changes

Fission CLI now communicates with Kubernetes API server directly.
We have removed the dependency on Fission controller.

This gives few benefits for the Fission users

- You can use Kubernetes RBAC to control access to Fission resources. Refer [RBAC Permissions for Fission CLI](/docs/usage/rbac-permissions/) for detailed info.
- Fission CLI can be used with any Kubernetes cluster Fission installed.
- Enhanced security during Fission CLI communication

Fission CLI has been updated to support multiple namespaces.
We have added/modified/deprecated couple of CLI options.
Please refer to [Fission CLI Reference](/docs/reference/fission-cli/) for a couple of more details.

- We have introduced two global flags `--namespace` and `--all-namespace` to specify the namespace for the Fission resources.
- One spec file can be used to apply resources in different namespaces.

Fission Logs CLI now works with Kubernetes, you don't need to set up influxdb to use this feature.

Introduced new flag `--imagepullsecret` to pull an image from a private registry for container function.

### Fission Core Changes

#### Multiple Namespaces Support in Helm Chart

We have major changes in Helm chart please **do not** skip this section.

- Fission installation by default supports a single namespace `defaultNamespace` when installed. If you want to enable multiple namespaces, please set it via `additionalFissionNamespaces` in Helm values. Please check [PR #2539](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2539) for details.
- You can also have multiple Fission installations on the same cluster within different namespaces.
- We are creating separate service accounts for each Fission service now and assign specific roles to them.

Fission now supports multiple namespaces.
This means that you can create functions, packages, triggers, etc. in different namespaces.
This is a major feature that enables Fission to be used in a multi-tenant environment.

#### Webhook Server Addition

We have added a new webhook server to Fission. This webhook server is responsible for validating Fission resources.
We have moved most of the validations from Fission controller and Fission CLI to webhook server. This gives us more flexibility to add more validations in the future.
By default, we create a self-signed certificate for the webhook server.
You can provide your own certificate via `webhook` section in Helm values or use cert-manager to create a certificate.

### Legacy behaviour of default namespace

Earlier when you used to create functions and environments in the `defaultNamespace` mentioned via Helm Chart, Fission used to function create resources in the `functionNamespace` and `builderNamespace`.
Where as for other namespaces, Fission used to create resources in the same namespace.
We have changed this behavior now. Fission will create resources in the same namespace for all namespaces.
If you want older behavior, you have to set `functionNamespace` and `builderNamespace` to `fission-function` and `fission-builder` respectively.
By default, these values are empty in 1.18.0 release.

### Security Context Enabled by Default

We have enabled security context by default in Helm chart.
This will run Fission services with non-root user.
You can disable it via `securityContext.enabled` in Helm values.

## Removal of ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding

We have removed ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding from Fission installation.
We are using Role and RoleBinding now, across Fission installation now.
So all get permissions to operate on Fission resources in the specific namespace.
We have also refactored lots of RBAC permissions across Helm chart to make Fission more secure.

## Deprecation

### Controller Deprecation

We have deprecated Fission controller and disabled it by default. You can enable it via `controller.enabled` in Helm values.

We plan to remove Fission controller in the next release.

### HTTP Trigger Deprecation

- HTTPTrigger/Route creation from Fission CLI is deprecated. Use `fission route create` instead. [PR #2171](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2171)
- We have deprecated `Spec.Method` in HTTPTrigger since 1.13.0, please use `Spec.Methods` instead.

## Removed

### Azure Storage Queue and Nats traditional connector

With the addition of KEDA connectors, we have removed the following connectors type fission.

- Remove deprecated Fission Azure Storage Queue connector [\#2404](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2404) ([sanketsudake](https://github.com/sanketsudake))
- Remove deprecated Fission Nats connector [\#2403](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2403) ([sanketsudake](https://github.com/sanketsudake))

### Prometheus chart dependency

We have removed the prometheus dependency because it's not required by default by fission. If you want to use canary functions or checkout fission metrics, we recommend using [prometheus-community/prometheus](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/prometheus-community/prometheus) or [prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack).

- \[helm chart\] Remove prometheus chart dependency from Fission [\#2371](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2371) ([sanketsudake](https://github.com/sanketsudake))

### Opentracing support removed

With addition of OpenTelemetry, we have removed OpenTracing instrumentation.
Since OpenTelemetry is a superset of OpenTracing, we recommend using OpenTelemetry for tracing.

- cleanup: Remove Opentracing support as no active users [\#2196](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2196) ([sanketsudake](https://github.com/sanketsudake))
- removed unused reference of TRACING\_SAMPLING\_RATE [\#2498](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2498) ([shubham-bansal96](https://github.com/shubham-bansal96))
