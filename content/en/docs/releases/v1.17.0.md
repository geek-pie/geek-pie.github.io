## Features

### Security Context Setting for Fission Installation

By default, Fission runs with the `default` security context. This means that it will be run as root.
We have added settings in Helm chart for securityContext across all services in Fission.
You can enable recommended securityContext settings during Fission installation.

E.g. By settings values in fission installation through  `values.yaml`

```yaml
    executor.securityContext.enabled: true
    router.securityContext.enabled: true
    buildermgr.securityContext.enabled: true
    controller.securityContext.enabled: true
    kubewatcher.securityContext.enabled: true
    storagesvc.securityContext.enabled: true
```

We plan to make this setting default in the future.

Also, we have added recommended security context for builder and function pods.

```yaml
    runtimePodSpec.enabled: true
    builderPodSpec.enabled: true
```

If you want to patch the security context or any fields for podSpec which are common across all functions you can modify `runtimePodSpec.podSpec` and `builderPodSpec.podSpec` in `values.yaml`

## Removed

### Azure Storage Queue and Nats traditional connector

With the addition of KEDA connectors, we have removed the following connectors type fission.

- Remove deprecated Fission Azure Storage Queue connector [\#2404](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2404) ([sanketsudake](https://github.com/sanketsudake))
- Remove deprecated Fission Nats connector [\#2403](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2403) ([sanketsudake](https://github.com/sanketsudake))

### Prometheus chart dependency

We have removed the prometheus dependency because it's not required by default by fission. If you want to use canary functions or checkout fission metrics, we recommend using [prometheus-community/prometheus](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/prometheus-community/prometheus) or [prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack).

- \[helm chart\] Remove prometheus chart dependency from Fission [\#2371](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2371) ([sanketsudake](https://github.com/sanketsudake))

### Opentracing support removed

With addition of OpenTelemetry, we have removed OpenTracing instrumentation.
Since OpenTelemetry is a superset of OpenTracing, we recommend using OpenTelemetry for tracing.

- cleanup: Remove Opentracing support as no active users [\#2196](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2196) ([sanketsudake](https://github.com/sanketsudake))
- removed unused reference of TRACING\_SAMPLING\_RATE [\#2498](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2498) ([shubham-bansal96](https://github.com/shubham-bansal96))
