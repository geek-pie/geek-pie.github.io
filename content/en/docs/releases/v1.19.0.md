## Features

### Poolmanager Enhancements

- Fission now support for handling concurrent request in case of pool manager function according to request per pod as defined by user.
- Fission now can dump function service cache only for pool manager function via HTTP end point in executor. This will help to debug pool manager functions by generating a text file inside temporary directory of executor pod. This text file will contain the information about the number of requests being served by a function pod, number of requests is waiting to be served by a pod, etc.

### Support for github container registry

We have added a support for github container registry in fission. Now fission images can be pull either from docker container registry or github container registry. Default will github container registry.

### Timer Enhancements

Whenever time trigger triggers multiple requests at the same time then it becomes difficult to find the problem without trace. Now fission has a support to trace all the requests with the help of open telemetry in case time trigger triggers multiple requests at the same time.
